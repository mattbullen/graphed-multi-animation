# Delta-Graphed Random CSS Animation

This is an earlier version of my [3D spline animation](https://github.com/mattbullen/3D-spline-animation) page. It animates a small SVG icon around the screen by tweening the CSS properties `margin-top` and `margin-left` to random values. Each property takes a randomly selected tweening pattern: plain linear intervals up to multi-knot splines.

At the end of the animation, the page loads two simple line graphs for each CSS property. Each graph shows a visual for the delta intervals of its corresponding tween, which is useful for matching the more complex splines to the movement of the box around the screen.
