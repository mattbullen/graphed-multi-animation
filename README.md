# Spline Path Animation

This is an earlier version of my [3D spline animation](https://github.com/mattbullen/3D-spline-animation) page. It animates a small SVG icon around the screen by looping over the icon's CSS properties `margin-top` and `margin-left` along randomly-generated paths, which can range from simple linear intervals to complex multi-knot spline paths.

Once you open the page, click on the blue checkmark in the upper-right corner of the screen to start a random animation sequence. At the end of the animation, the page generates a line graph for each CSS property and path. Each graph shows the delta intervals of its corresponding path, which is useful for matching more complex splines to the movement of the icon on the screen.
